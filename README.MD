## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendations.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Use the following command to install the `requests` library for making API calls to TMDb:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Step 3: File Setup

1. **Download `FindAMovie.py`**: Save the script in a folder on your computer.
2. **Create Your JSON File**: Place a JSON file named `watched_movies.json` in the same directory as `FindAMovie.py`. Use this format for each movie you've watched:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "title": "Inception",
            "genres": ["Action", "Science Fiction"],
            "rating": 8.8,
            "release_year": 2010
        },
        {
            "title": "The Dark Knight",
            "genres": ["Action", "Drama"],
            "rating": 9.0,
            "release_year": 2008
        }
        // Add more movies here
    ]
    ```

3. **Update the API Key**:  
   - Open `FindAMovie.py` in a text editor.
   - Replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY` with your TMDb API key on the line:

     ```python
     TMDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"
     ```
